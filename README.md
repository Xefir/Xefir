### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Michel Roux**, a ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· french ðŸ§° handyman as comfortable with code as on a terminal.
I juggle three hats :
- Web Developer
- DevOps
- System Administrator

You'll not find much here because I host pretty much everything I make or publish.

Please forward to my âš¡ **[Gitea](https://git.crystalyx.net/Xefir)** âš¡ to see all my projects !
